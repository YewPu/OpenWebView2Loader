# OpenWebView2Loader
OpenWebView2Loader is a reimplementation of WebView2Loader. It is intended to
be feature-complete with the original WebView2Loader distributed with the
WebView2 NuGet package.

For most intents and purposes, you should prefer using the official
WebView2Loader. This implementation may be of interest if you need to
understand how WebView2Loader works and could be used to implement
WebView2Loader in another programming language without needing a C++
dependency.
